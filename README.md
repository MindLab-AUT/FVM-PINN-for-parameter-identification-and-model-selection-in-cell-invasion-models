Accurate modeling of a phenomenon is essential for enhancing predictive capabilities
and understanding its underlying mechanisms. The precision of model predictions is
heavily influenced by the parameters of the model. Consequently, in addition to
addressing problems framed as Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) or Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs), parameter estimation is crucial for improving solution
accuracy and selecting the optimal model among alternatives. This study focuses on
estimating the parameters of the Fisher-KPP (Ronald Fisher, Andrey Kolmogorov, Ivan
Petrovsky, Nikolai Piskunov) model using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).
The Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion model, which explores cell invasion, has four
variants depending on whether the parameters are free or fixed. We employ the finite
volume method (FVM) to simulate the model and obtain numerical solutions.
